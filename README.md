## Hey there 👋

🐙 I've been active on GitHub [since 2014](https://firstcommit.is/pi0) and now work as a full-time open-source maintainer thanks to [Nuxtlabs](https://nuxtlabs.com/) and [Passionatepeople](https://passionatepeople.io/) that made it possible.

💚 I've been involved in the development of [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt) since 2017.

💛 And I make open solutions in [UnJS](https://github.com/unjs), which includes **50+** libraries with **395+ million** monthly downloads on NPM.

❤️ Your [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/pi0) means a lot to me and supports what I do.

💬 You can find me in twitter via [`@_pi0_`](https://twitter.com/_pi0_), discord via `@pi0` or email via `pooya+gh@pi0.io`.

## Some facts

🐱 I love cats. Tommy reviews most of my code.

◼️ Dark mode, semi; and spaces.
